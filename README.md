Macaulay2 Examples from the Singular Book

How to Install
--

Just as any other Macaulay2 package. First put the file `SingularExamples.m2` in the correct directory,
e.g. on my system, this is
```
/Applications/Macaulay2-1.*/share/Macaulay2
```
and then install from within a Macaualay2 session run
```
installPackage "SingularExamples"
viewHelp "SingularExamples"
```
